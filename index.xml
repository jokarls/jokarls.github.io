      <description>In 2015 when Garmin launched the Connect IQ platform, I was eager to try it out. Together with a friend, I started an ambitious app project and I knew that we need a build server of some sort. The solution back then was an old laptop running Jenkins, triggering builds on pushes to our GitHub repository.
Since then I&amp;rsquo;ve learned Docker and GitHub have released their Actions feature. So coming back to Connect IQ development, after a few years, those felt like good technologies to use when setting up a continuous integration pipeline.</description>
